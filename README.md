## What is Flowga?
Flowga is a yoga application that is suitable for anyone, a beginner or an experienced yogist. The main idea behind Flowga, is to generate semi-randomized yoga workouts for the user. The users select the duration, and nature of the workout, after which a workour is presented to them. <br />
-> If they are not happy with the generated workout, they can reroll to get a different workout.
